Description: Implements an algorithm for generating maps, known as tile maps,
    in which each region is represented by a single tile of the same shape and
    size. The algorithm was first proposed in "Generating Tile Maps" by Graham
    McNeill and Scott Hale (2017) <doi:10.1111/cgf.13200>. Functions allow
    users to generate, plot, and compare square or hexagon tile maps.
